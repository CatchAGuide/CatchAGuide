Drift fishing and vertical fishing are specialized techniques for targeting fish at different depths. Ultralight fishing is a lighter variant for small predatory fish and is fun on small rivers and lakes. Ice fishing is a special experience in winter when you want to fish on frozen lakes in Scandinavia or northeastern Europe. Jigging and hardbait are modern methods using artificial lures that are especially effective for perch, pike, and zander. Live bait fishing is a traditional method where you use live baitfish to attract large predatory fish like pike or catfish.
